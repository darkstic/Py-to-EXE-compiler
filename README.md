Instructions:
_____________________________________________

1. Download and run the Python file with a python interpreter or in a code editor.
    (Or use it to compile itself and run as an .EXE I guess)
   
3. Be patient as the program determines whether or not your system has the necessary packages installed, if not they will be installed automatically.

4. A small GUI popup window will prompt you to check whether or not you want to compile with a console. Compiling with a console means that the finished file with run with a black console window, displaying any text output for the program. If your program has a GUI, I would reccomend against compiling with a console.

5. Select your desired Python file in the file dialog menu and continue to process and compile the file. This process might take some time depending on the size of the file and the complexity of the packages it imports.

6. Once finished, the program will open a file explorer window to the path where your .EXE is located.

7. Enjoy your file, you nerd!
